- Neural Networks:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN);
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN);
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM);

## Unsupervised Learning
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN);
  - K-means;
  - Hierarchical Clustering;
  - Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM);

## Reinforcement Learning

## Self-Supervised Learning
  - It is both **unsupervised** in the sense that the input data is unlabelled, and **supervised** in the sense that the data itself provides the necessary context which would ordinarily make up the labels. For example: creating word embeddings.

## Cross-Model Techniques
  - Feature Selection;
  - Model Evaluation and Validation;
  - Hypothesis Testing;
    - Chi-square test: check dependece between two categorical variables using contingency tables;
    - ANOVA;
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA);

## Machine Learning Tools
  - MLFlow;

## Data Processing and Feature Engineering Techniques
  - Data profiling;
  - PySpark;
  - SQL;
  - Python;
